/**
 * Brian's brain is a cellular automaton model that consists of 3 types of cells (pixels).
 * A cell can be either alive, in a dying state of dead.
 * A cell that is alive goes into a dying state in the next frame, and a cell that is in the dying state dies in the next time frame.
 * Only a cell that is dead can be turned on (alive) again.
 * To do so, the cell must have 2 cells in the cell's moore neighborhood in order to be turned alive again.
 * Sources for rules:
 * Wikipedia, 2023
 * Vogel, 2018
 * The idea of checking whether the cells are going to be alive or dead in the next frame using methods comes from: Algosome, n.d.
