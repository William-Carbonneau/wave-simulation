/**
 * This simulation simulates a forest. 
 * A forest has 3 types of spots: (1) A given spot can have tree growing on it, or (2) that spot can have a tree that is burning, or (3) that spot can be burnt.
 * By default, the forest starts with all burnt spots (No trees or burning trees).
 * Based on certain probabilities, a tree can grow.
 * Then, once a tree has been grown, there is a probability that this tree will catch fire.
 * These 2 probabilities are controlled by the user using sliders.
 * Once a tree has caugth fire, it will burn all the trees that are arund it.
 * And once a tree has caugth fire, it is guaranteed that it will be burnt in the next frame.
 * Source for Rules:
 * Dingeldein, n.d.
 * The idea of checking whether the cells are going to be alive or dead in the next frame using methods comes from: Algosome, n.d.
